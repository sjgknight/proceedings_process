Some scripts intended to help in proces of collating papers for production of a conference proceedings (Specifically, from easychair, and for both a Springer volume, and supplementary proceedings).

Mileage may vary...

Create a `.Rprofile` file containing:

`googlesheet_address = "a-url-to-a-googlesheet-with-a-sheet-of-papers"`

You may need `basedir_full` and `basedir_supplement`

`basedir = "c:/a-directory-path-with-the-papers-in"`

`basename` describes the format of the filenames (from easychair in our case) prior to processing, e.g. ICQE23_paper_23.pdf, provide in form:

`basename = "ICQE23_paper_"`

`newname` describes the prepended volume number (for Springer)

`newname = "1895-"`

`editors` describes the editor names, string:

`editors = "Golnaz Arastoopour Irgens, Simon Knight"`

licensename = "ICQE23_LicensetoPublishForm_"

Running the below will create the template:

`writeLines('googlesheet_address = "xxx"\nbasedir_full = "xxx"\nbasedir_supplement = "xxx"\nbasename = "xxx"\nnewname = "xxx"\neditors = "xxx"\nlicensename = "xxx"', con = ".Rprofile")`

I'm lazy so add

```
pacman::p_load(dplyr,
               magrittr,
               tibble,
               tidyr,
               fs,
               stringr,
               pdftools)
```
